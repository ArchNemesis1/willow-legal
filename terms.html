    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 06/18/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By creating an account and using the Willow mobile application (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding your account and for any activities or actions under your password. You must be at least 13 years of age to create an account and use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for the content you post, upload, or otherwise make available on the forum, including text and images ("User Content"). You retain all ownership rights to your User Content. However, by posting it, you grant Willow a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display, reproduce, and distribute your User Content within the context of operating and providing the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Community Guidelines & Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
        You agree not to post User Content that is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or libelous.</li>
        <li>Hateful, discriminatory, or promotes violence against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, or sexual orientation.</li>
        <li>Spam, including unsolicited promotions or commercial content.</li>
        <li>Maliciously false, including misinformation related to pet health that could cause harm.</li>
        <li>Graphically violent or sexually explicit.</li>
        <li>Infringes on any third party's copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Moderation and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
        We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor all User Content. We use automated systems to scan text and images for potentially inappropriate content. Content flagged by these systems may be hidden from public view pending review. Other users may report your content if they believe it violates these terms. We reserve the right to remove any User Content, or to suspend or terminate your account at our sole discretion, without prior notice, for any reason, including but not limited to a breach of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
        The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Advice and information shared by users on the forum are the opinions of those users and not of Willow. You should always consult a qualified veterinarian for professional medical advice regarding your pet's health.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        In no event shall Willow, nor its owners or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages resulting from your use of the Service or from any content posted by other users.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
